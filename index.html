        <h6 class="sliderentry right">To be a successful entrepreneur, it's not enough to just work hard....</h6>
        <p class="sliderentry right"><strong>I'm about to list 5 crucial qualities that will make or break your journey as an entrepreneur</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li class="sliderentry right"><strong>Emotional intelligence -</strong><br>
                Successful entrepreneurs never let their emotions make decisions for them. They recognise their emotions at any given situation and handle them accordingly.</li>
                <li class="sliderentry right"><strong>Time Management -</strong><br>You are losing customers and clients if your business is not seen as efficient. As an entrepreneur, you should be able to prioritize tasks and meet deadlines.</li>
                <li class="sliderentry right"><strong>People management -</strong><br>Your clients and customers are people...<br>You delegate tasks to people since doing everything on your own can burn you out<br>Your relationship with these people determines if you lose them or gain their loyalty.</li>
                <li class="sliderentry right"><strong>Resilience -</strong><br>The ability to rise again no matter how many times you fall, learning from your mistakes each time.</li>
                <li class="sliderentry right"><strong>Marketing skill -</strong><br>Being a successful entrepreneur involves consistently growing your income through increased clients or higher product prices tied to improved quality.<br>Without marketing knowledge, relying solely on hard work is like pouring water into a basket.</li>
                
            </ul>
            <p><strong><i>Developing all these qualities on your own can be extremely hard especially if you are new on the entrepreneurship train.</i></strong></p>
